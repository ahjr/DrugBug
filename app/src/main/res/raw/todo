todo Swipe right goes back
-- This is more complicated than I had anticipated
-- http://androidexample.com/Swipe_screen_left__right__top_bottom/index.php?view=article_discription&aid=95&aaid=118

todo Handle missed doses better
-- Show only one entry in list "Med Name - # missed"/"Last missed dose: Date/time"
-- Clicking shows list of all missed doses

todo Handle reminder changes better
-- Currently removing reminder from one dose changes all
-- Should probably give the option to remove all or one

todo Future dose list help screen is wrong --> Can't replicate this, so probably a testing glitch

todo Back from Medication list(inactive) -> dose list returns to default filter
-- Pretty sure the only way to change this is to have 2 different filter extras (med_filter and dose_filter?)

todo Possible --> should taking dose shift all future doses?

todo Implement Frequency customization

todo Give user the ability to set meal and waking times for more accuracy

todo Some Activity classes are doing too much.  Need to refactor.

todo Normalize drawables (size/color/name).  Remove unused.

todo Extract string resources from code (probably still some in xml too)
-- Find in Path (regular expression) ".*"

todo Trace usage of Context
-- I'm almost certainly using it wrong in some places

todo All doses showing as red at the moment.  Not sure why.  May be related to the AddDoseActivity refactor.
