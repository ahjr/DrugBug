[FEATURE] todo Swipe right goes back
-- This is more complicated than I had anticipated
-- http://androidexample.com/Swipe_screen_left__right__top_bottom/index.php?view=articlediscription&aid=95&aaid=118

[FEATURE] todo Handle reminder changes better
-- Currently removing reminder from one dose changes all
-- Should probably give the option to remove all or one

[FEATURE] todo Back from Medication list(inactive) -> dose list returns to default filter
-- Pretty sure the only way to change this is to have 2 different filter extras (med_filter and dose_filter?)

[FEATURE] todo Possible --> should taking dose shift all future doses?

[FEATURE] todo Implement Frequency customization

[FEATURE] todo Give user the ability to set meal and waking times for more accuracy

[FEATURE] todo Add sort medication list by last taken dose

[FEATURE] todo Handle missed doses better
-- Show only one entry in list "Med Name - # missed"/"Last missed dose: Date/time"
-- Clicking shows list of all missed doses
-- This will fix the dose time change to the past bug

[FEATURE] todo Add sort by id (creation date) to medication list sort order

[BUG] todo Changing dose time backwards breaks generating new future doses

[REFACTOR] todo Some Activity classes are doing too much.  Need to refactor.

[REFACTOR] todo Normalize drawables (size/color/name).  Remove unused.

[REFACTOR] todo Extract string resources from code (probably still some in xml too)
-- Find in Path (regular expression) ".*"

[REFACTOR] todo Trace usage of Context
-- I'm almost certainly using it wrong in some places
-- https://possiblemobile.com/2013/06/context/

[REFACTOR] todo Convert list activities to fragments

[REFACTOR] todo Change add dose to dialog?  Would make formatting for tablets better.
